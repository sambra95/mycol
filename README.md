# **Mycol**

_A lightweight, human-in-the-loop microscopy image analysis app._

Mycol is a Streamlit-based application that makes machine-learning-assisted microscopy analysis accessible to non-specialists. It enables fast annotation, automated segmentation and classification, model fine-tuning, and quantitative phenotyping, all on a standard laptop and without coding.

## **Features**

### **Annotation & QC**

- Upload images and optional masks
- Manual mask drawing and editing
- SAM2-guided segmentation
- Automated Cellpose segmentation (single or batch mode)
- Interactive classification (manual or DenseNet-based)

### **Model Fine-Tuning**

- Train Cellpose (segmentation) and DenseNet (classification) models directly in the app
- Default training settings for general use
- Diagnostic outputs:
  - Loss curves
  - IoU scores
  - True vs. predicted counts
  - Accuracy, precision, F1, confusion matrix
- Download trained models and training summaries

### **Cell Metrics & Phenotyping**

- Automatic computation of cell descriptors (size, shape, elongation, compactness, etc.)
- Visual comparison of phenotypic classes
- Export plots and tabulated descriptors
- Built-in explanations for descriptor interpretation

### **Lightweight & Accessible**

- Runs locally on standard hardware
- Minimal dependencies
- Designed for small-scale workflows

## **Installation**

> [!NOTE]
> This project uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as its package manager. It is a drop-in replacement for `pip` and `conda` that handles the virtual environment and dependencies for you. To install it, run `pip install uv` or follow the [official instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sambra95/mycol.git
```

**2. Navigate into the repository in your terminal**

```bash
cd mycol
```

**3. Install dependencies**

This automatically creates a virtual environment and installs everything the app needs.

```bash
uv sync
```

---

## **Run the App locally**

From inside the repository, run:

```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

`uv run` executes the command inside the project's virtual environment. Alternatively, you can activate the environment first (`source .venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows) and then run `streamlit run app.py`.

## **Example Use Cases**

- Rapid cell counting
- Creating curated datasets of annotated images
- Automating image annotation (with human QC)
- Morphology-based phenotypic comparison
